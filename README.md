diarmuidie/envpopulate
=============

PHP tool to interactively generate a `.env` file from an `example.env` file on Composer install and update.

Developed by [Diarmuid](https://diarmuid.ie/).

Based on the similar package [Incenteev/ParameterHandler](https://github.com/Incenteev/ParameterHandler) that works on YAML files.

Installation
------------

You can install EnvPopulate through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```shell
$ composer require diarmuidie/envpopulate
```

To trigger the EnvPopulate script on composer install and updates you have to add the following scripts to your `composer.json` file:

```JSON
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "Diarmuidie\\EnvPopulate\\ScriptHandler::populateEnv"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "Diarmuidie\\EnvPopulate\\ScriptHandler::populateEnv"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Optional
If you want to change the location of the example or generated env file you can also add an extra section to the `composer.json` file:
```JSON
"extra": {
    "env-process": {
        "example-file": "app/.env.dist",
        "generated-file": "app/.env"
    }
}
```


Usage
-----

Make sure you have an `example.env` file in the root of your project (or in a different location by [setting the extra options](#optional).

The script will run every time you do a `composer install` or `composer update`. Press enter to accept the default value or type to overwrite it.
